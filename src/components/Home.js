            <h3>About</h3>
            <p>Hello, I'm Nathan. I'm a graduate of the University of Glasgow with a 2.1 honours degree in Computer Science, specialising in Theoretical
                Computer Science. I am a compulsive problem solver, and take great satisfaction in adapting and developing solutions to
                complex tasks. After taking some time to work on myself, I am excited to now turn my focus to developing my career. I am
                interested in working with emerging technologies and learning new skills, as I did when working on my dissertation. After
                developing my skills working in an engineering team as both a member and a coach, I am looking forward to participating in a
                group environment again.</p>
